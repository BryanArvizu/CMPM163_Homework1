# HOW-TO
1, 2, and 3 keys switch Scenes
Arrow Keys or WASD Keys alter image on Scene 2

# ADDITIONAL NOTES

Part A:
The homework didn't explicitly say to remake all the shaders needed in
the part A (scene 1), so due to time constraints I reused the twist shader 
provided in class. The Phong and Texture shader were modified by me to spin
and in the case of the former, accept multiple lights.

Part C:
The shader is a modified game of life, which reduces death conditions and
moves the "life indicator" value off of the red channel and onto the alpha
channel. This was done so that the red channel could change over time,
depending on how long a particular pixel has lived.
